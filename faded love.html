       <p>I think that the image of each other in the eyes of lovers is never the same, and they seldom see each other's image objectively. In love, the relationship between lovers will go through many stages. In each stage, the relationship between lovers' interaction and feelings will be different, and the image in each other's eyes will also change accordingly.<br>

        The image of a lover is not always the same, it is an image controlled by time, events, emotions, etc. It is no longer the objective and real appearance of a lover, but perhaps a lover who is composed of many aspects is the real appearance of a lover. Therefore, in the center of the whole exhibition, the image of the lover is divided into four periods. From back to front, they are the starting period, the hot-blooded period, the teething period, and the stable period. The images of lovers in the four periods are combined together to show the mixed memories of lovers in the human brain. </p>

       <p >Chocolate will temporarily raise your dopamine levels to 1.5 times the baseline level, and the effect will disappear after a few minutes or even seconds; inhaled nicotine, such as cigarettes, will raise dopamine levels to more than 2.5 times the baseline level, and this effect is very unhealthy; cocaine will raise dopamine levels in the blood to 2.5 times the baseline level, and amphetamines (stimulants) will raise dopamine levels in the blood to more than 10 times the baseline level. stimulants) will raise dopamine levels in the blood to more than ten times the baseline level; love, whether it's a real relationship or a brief moment of pleasure in romance literature, will raise dopamine levels to more than 1.5 times the baseline level. Reading a romance novel is like having a chemical reaction inside your skull.</p>

       <p >Romance novels serve the human process, from the reader's desire to read a book to the completion of the book, the lasting memory and impact of the book on the person. Each process extends to the role played by other actors such as publishers, authors, etc. in the proces</p>
